### **PREREQUISITES**

This file contains the modules we need to import for our program. Use the below command:

_Python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt_


_Sys_msgs.py_

This file will contain the explanations of the individual agent functions that OLLAMA will refer to, while deciding what the work of that agent function is. If you think over it, you might come up with better and more detailed explanations for the agents which will make your assistant perform better.





This flowchart below depicts the 4 agent functions( diamonds) and 2 worker functions(squares) used in fetching user input, generating the query, parsing the query from the database and providing the best search result to the user.

### **GLOBAL VARIABLES**

assistant_convo=[sys_msgs.assistant_msg]

- Global empty list for storing the responses from our assistant


### **AGENT AND WORKER FUNCTION IN ORDER OF THEIR CALLING AND USAGE**

**SEARCH_OR_NOT AGENT FUNCTION THAT RECEIVES USER INPUT AND DECIDES WHETHER TO SEARCH OR NOT**

-This function fetches the user input and generates a token (T/F) depending on whether the input needs a web search or not. If it returns True, then the program proceeds otherwise the output is generated by our Ollama model itself.

The token is stored in 'content', and the complete message is stored in our empty list.


**AGENT FUNCTION THAT CREATES A SEARCH QUERY TO SEARCH ON DUCKDUCKGO**

-This function transforms the input received from the user and converts it into a query which will be used to search on DuckDuckGo. 

Content will store the query which will be called by our worker function ai_search().

**WORKER FUNCTION TO SEARCH THE GENERATED QUERY ON DUCKDUCKGO**

-We are calling the generated query and transforming it into an URL to search for it in DuckDuckGo which is a search engine like Google. 

Then we are storing the response in response.text and calling BeautifulSoup function which is an inbuilt function that fetches all the data on a webpage and we are saving it in a variable called soup. 

Then we are initializing an empty list called 'results' and running a loop to get the first 10 search results and keep a counter called 'start' which starts at 1. 

Then we will search for the link in class 'result__a' which starts with 'a', and then save it as a link. We will do the same for the snippet and then append the link and snippet to our 'results' list.


**AGENT FUNCTION TO SELECT THE BEST SEARCH RESULT FROM AMONG THE 10 SEARCH RESULTS THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR WORKER FUNCTION DUCKDUCKGOSEARCH()**

-We will run a loop that allows the function 2 tries to get the best search result and stores it in 'content'. If the function is unable to get the best search result after 2 tries then the program continues on to the next function. 


**WORKER FUNCTION TO SCRAPE THE WEBPAGE USING TRAFILATURA**

-Trafilatura extract() helps us in fetching the text from a webpage without the HTML code, while including the formatting and links that are available in the page. 

We run the extract function where we call the url of the link we had stored for our best_search_result.


**AGENT FUNCTION TO EVALUATE IF DATA IS RELEVANT**

-This is our final agent function to determine whether the data we have received from our previous agent and worker functions is relevant to the query that our user has asked. 

We check the relevance using OLLAMA model and save the response in 'content' in true/false format.

**AI WORKER FUNCTION TO HANDLE WEB SEARCH LOGIC, RETURNS CONTEXT FOR OUR PROMPT**

-This is a worker function which first receives the search query generated in our query_generator()function. 

We have noticed that whenever OLLAMA3.1 generates a search query it generates in within double quotes(") therefore we will modify the search_query to exclude the first and last characters.

In search_results we will store the search result after searching for the query using our duckduckgosearch() worker function

Then we are running a loop for all the results found and storing the best result in the variable of the same name after running the best_search_result function. Then we are using 'try' to create a dictionary called page_link which contains the best_result and the link to the site from where we found the best_result. In case 'try' fails, then the program will restart.

We are running the scrape_webpage() function where we call trafilatura and saving the result in page_text variable. Once we show the best search result we are removing that result from our list using pop(). 

**STREAM FUNCTION THAT STORES THE DATA AS IT IS RECEIVED FROM THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS**

-Defined assistant_convo list as a global variable so that all the functions can access it and append the response from OLLAMA model to the complete response string regarding what the assistant is doing.


**MAIN FUNCTION**

-First we are taking input in 'prompt' variable and appending it to the assistant_convo variable. Then starting the search_or_not() function. If return is true, then the loop starts where we call ai_search worker function which receives the query and calls the individual agent functions as we explained previously. We save the return in 'context' and if it is true, we will output the search result that was saved in 'context' received from the OLLAMA model, otherwise we will declare a failed statement.

This prompt will be appended to the assistant_convo list and we will call the stream_assistant_response() to show the user the current state of the assistant.
